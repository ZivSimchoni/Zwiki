## **General Guidelines**

Please ensure your pull request / issue report adheres to the following guidelines:<br>
:white_check_mark: Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.<br>
:white_check_mark: Titles should be capitalized.<br>
:white_check_mark: Make an individual pull/issue for each suggestion.<br>
:white_check_mark: When adding a link Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`<br>
:white_check_mark: Links should refer to the official website or github repository of the program in question. (Both would be great, if possible).<br>
:white_check_mark: Check your spelling and grammar. **(and mine)**

### **Pull** Contribution Method

Make sure your list is useful before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.<br>
:white_check_mark: Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.<br>
:white_check_mark: Titles must contain minimal yet useful information.<br>
:white_check_mark: New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.<br>
:white_check_mark: Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.<br>

### **Issue** Contribution Method

Open an issue with the name of the program as the title.<br>
:exclamation: If any of the links are dead, please open and issue and add any up-to-date links that you can provide.<br>


??? Note "**Email** Contribution Method"
    If don't want to use any of the methods above you can send me an email on [zivs@duck.com](mailto:zivs@duck.com).<br>
