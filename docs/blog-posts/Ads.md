# Tired Of These Ads? There’s A Solution.
Wouldn't it be nicer to have a cleaner website, without the ads feeling the site and interrupting actual content you're viewing? <br>
For most of the cases Ad blockers extensions/Add-ons the solution.<br>

## Ad Blockers

As the name suggests, Ad blockers are designed to block ads.<br>
Though **no system is 100% accurate** most of the ads will be caught in the Ad blocker mighty “spider web”.<br>
The most common ad blockers are web-browser add-ons and are “plug and play”, after you're installing them there's a little to nothing to mess with to make it work.<br>

Recommended Ad Blockers:

-   UBlock Origin (**my personal favorite**, and the first addon I install in any web browser)
-   AdBlock
-   AdBlock Plus

!!! info "I’d recommend modifying the settings and block lists inside the chosen add-on as per your preferences and needs."

## Domain Name System (DNS, for short)
[DNS](DNS.md) is the “phone-book” of the internet,
The “set and forget” method, navigate to the internet settings and set your private dns for `dns.adguard.com` **or** navigate to `nextdns.io` configure your DNS and follow the instructions in the setup guide accordingly to your device.<br>

## Hosts File

!!! info "Compared to the previous section, using the hosts files method is less beginner (newbie) friendly."


**What is a “Hosts file”?**<br>
A quick and short description:<br>
Hosts file is a text file in a system that contains a list of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses. is used to allow or deny access to specific websites.<br>
The hosts file is a text file
(For further and in depth explanation check [Wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)>)

**Recommended Hosts Files:**

-   Steven Black
-   Peter Lowe
