When a stub resolver gets a request from an application, it first checks its own cache to see if it has the record.If it does not, it then sends a DNS query (with a recursive flag set), outside the local network to a DNS recursive resolver inside the Internet service provider (ISP).</p> <p>When the recursive resolver inside the ISP receives a DNS query, like all previous steps, it will also check to see if the requested host-to-IP-address translation is already stored inside its local persistence layer.</p> <p>The recursive resolver also has additional functionality depending on the types of records it has in its cache:</p> <ol> <li>If the resolver does not have the A records, but does have the NS records for the authoritative nameservers, it will query those name servers directly, bypassing several steps in the DNS query. This shortcut prevents lookups from the root and .com nameservers (in our search for example.com) and helps the resolution of the DNS query occur more quickly.</li> <li>If the resolver does not have the NS records, it will send a query to the TLD servers (.com in our case), skipping the root server.</li> <li>In the unlikely event that the resolver does not have records pointing to the TLD servers, it will then query the root servers. This event typically occurs after a DNS cache has been purged.</li> </ol> <p></p>"}, {"location": "blog-posts/2022/DNS/#how-to-change-dns-settings-in-your-system", "title": "How To Change DNS Settings in your system?", "text": "<p>Exit everything that uses the network and then follow the steps below.</p> <p>I am using Quad9 DNS, feel free to choose any other provider some that I recommend.</p>"}, {"location": "blog-posts/2022/DNS/#windows-pcs", "title": "Windows PCs", "text": "<p>Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Click Win Key + X.</li> <li>Click Network Connections.</li> <li>Click Change Adapter Options.</li> <li>Right-click the desired network adapter (Wired or Wi-Fi adapter).</li> <li>Click on the Properties button.</li> <li>Click on the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4).</li> <li>Click on the Properties button.</li> <li>Click on Use the following DNS server addresses:</li> <li>Change the DNS servers to the ones you want.</li> <li>Click on the OK button.     *Optional: Select IPv6 in Step 7 and continue to the next steps.</li> </ol> Click me to view screenshots for the steps above <p> </p> <p>Alternative Way:</p> <ol> <li>Open the Windows Control Panel.</li> <li>Click on the Network and Internet tab.</li> <li>Click on the Network tab.</li> <li>Click on the Network And Sharing Settings button.</li> <li>Click on the connection name should be Wired: (NETWORK NAME) or Wi-Fi: (NETWORK NAME).</li> <li>Click Properties.</li> <li>Continue from step 6 above.</li> </ol>"}, {"location": "blog-posts/2022/DNS/#linux-machines", "title": "Linux Machines", "text": "<p>Im using Fedora 35, there might be slight differences in the settings for the other Distros though the general guidelines are the same.</p> <p>Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Right-click the desktop.</li> <li>Click Settings.</li> <li>Click Network.</li> <li>Click IPv4.</li> <li>Turn Off Automatic DNS.</li> <li>Change the DNS servers to the ones you want.</li> <li>Click on the Apply button.    *Optional: Select IPv6 in Step 4 and continue to the next steps.</li> </ol> <p>Alternative Way: Change DNS using the terminal, example Here</p> Click me to view Linux screenshots <p> </p> <ol> <li> <p>Thanks for CloudFlare for their post, for further information and more details check their blog: What is DNS? | How DNS works \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "blog-posts/2022/Online-Security/", "title": "What is online security?", "text": "<p>Online security is something most of us use on a daily basis \u2013 sometimes we don\u2019t even know we are using it!
